# FileExplorer
A file explorer built with WPF and C#. The user can choose a directory to parse and will be provided with a visual tree representation.  From the visual tree the user is able to select directories, sub-directories and files. Information is displayed at the bottom about the number and size of the directories and files selected. This project demonstrates the use of bindings in WPF.
